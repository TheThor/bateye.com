			<p>We personify in the furniture the collective memory of places, through moments, expressions, textures and chromatic seized in the cities. We want to create pieces from the whole world, for the whole world.</p>
			<b>What moves us?</b>
			<h1>Bat eye has in its genesis a creative, Marco Sousa, who, following his graduation, and after years of dedication to architecture and passion for cities, felt the need to create furniture that caught in the elements of convergence between art and architecture, transcribing for furniture the forms, movements, gestures and colors that he kept with his look. </h1>
			<h1>Cities tell stories, we heard them and seize them, we interpret them and recreate that distinct and personal vision. The city conveys life in every corner, in every street that goes unnoticed, even in places where people least expect it.</h1>
			<h1>Provoke, stimulate and seduce: these are the attributes present in each Bat eyeâ€™s piece. The ability to create, take risks and assume challenges moves us. Result of our genuine passion for the cities, we challenge the conventional, we take risks and create: in each piece, we awake the emotions of who contemplates it. We want people to keep parts of the cities in their homes. We seek to create collective memories, repre- sented in the form of furniture.</h1>
