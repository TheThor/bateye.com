# bateye.com
Legacy project for bateye.com in Symfony 1.4.

It includes a symfony 4 migration branch.

I'm including here because this is a legacy project, no longer online. 

**Important Notes**

It has could have code that shouldn't be pushed/commited, specially if you are on a public repo, like env variables that could contain passwords/others.
